```

## Usage

Work in progress. For now, see the examples:

- [Joke generator](https://github.com/statelyai/agent/tree/main/examples/joke.ts)
  - Demonstrates `agent.fromChatCompletion(...)` to generate a joke and provide a joke rating
  - Demonstrates `agent.fromEvent(...)` to choose whether to keep generating jokes or stop
- [Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/statelyai/agent/tree/main/examples/ticTacToe.ts)
  - Demonstrates `agent.fromEvent(...)` to have an agent play itself in a game of tic-tac-toe with precise events
  - Demonstrates `agent.fromChatCompletionStream(...)` to produce a game report at the end of the game
- [Weather](https://github.com/statelyai/agent/tree/main/examples/weather.ts)
  - Demonstrates using [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) as an external API
  - Demonstrates `agent.fromEvent(...)` to only use Tavily to get the weather if the user provides a valid location
